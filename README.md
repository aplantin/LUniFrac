## LUniFrac
Calculates a Longitudinal UniFrac dissimilarity matrix. This is a two-stage UniFrac-type metric that calculates (normalized) changes in the microbiota between two time points, then compares these changes between individuals. This dissimilarity may be used in any downstream analysis requiring a beta-diversity summary.
